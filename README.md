# DiscordBotWA
Code for a project I did a while back in Javascript; A bot for querying Wolfram Alpha API within the Discord desktop application. Very barebones. This project is mostly for playing with async in JS, but does work nicely.

foo.gif is the image that is returned by one of the methods, as an example. The other method simply returns the most likely result and prints it in text form.

Uploading files rather than pushing to remove ties to personal account.
